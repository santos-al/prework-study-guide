          <li>git add -A: the 'add' command adds modifications in the current working
            branch to the staging area. The '-A' flags indicates that we want to add all
            changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next

            source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The 'main' keyword indicates 
            the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called 'main' from the 
            GitHub repo. It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you 
            have the latest version of the project your local computer before you start to
            work. Otherwise, you might be working on outdated code.

          <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: The 'push' command can be used to
            push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch. This command

            branch. The 'feature/starter-code' is the name of the branch.
